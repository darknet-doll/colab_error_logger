**The Impact Counter** tracks how often my code breaks; turning each count into ways daddy will debug me later. On my OF page, each crash doesn’t just log an error — it counts toward a spanking 💥 for some good old-fashioned impact play. Debugging has never been this fun (or this painful).

**The Impact Counter is a simple Python utility** (built for Jupyter / Google Colab) that logs when your code errors out, counts the failures, and gives you analytics over time. This is also perfect for:
- Tracking your coding crashes
- Turning error logs into playful accountability tools
- Learning Python
- Show how debugging can be measurable to improve coding skills over time
### Features:
- 🔥 Real-time counter — see how many times your code failed
- 📝 Error logging — keeps track of what failed, when, and in which function
- 📊 Visualization — chart your errors over time with Pandas + Matplotlib
